# 🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of stroke occurrence using Machine Learning models based on clinical and demographic features.  
It applies supervised learning techniques to assist in early risk identification.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Stroke risk prediction using Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
- Data preprocessing (missing value imputation, encoding, scaling)
- 80–20 train-test validation split
- Confusion matrix & classification report generation
- Correlation heatmap visualization
- Flask-based real-time prediction interface
