# ML-Brain-Stroke-Prediction

ML-based system to predict the likelihood of brain stroke using clinical and lifestyle data, enabling early risk detection and preventive healthcare decisions.

This project implements a machine learning–based brain stroke prediction system that analyzes patient health parameters to estimate stroke risk. It uses Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to identify patterns in medical data such as age, BMI, glucose level, hypertension, and heart disease. The system helps in early detection of stroke risk, supporting proactive medical intervention and reducing long-term complications.
